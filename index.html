					<h3>Paradox Paradise</h3>
					<p>For the "Game Design I" subject, I designed a tabletop party game. In this project I was in
						charge of all of the design of the game, as well as the visuals, and documentation. The video
						tutorial for the game can be seen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_t_ILSOj_Y">

					<h3>M.A.D. Barcelona</h3>
					<p style="font-size: 90%">For the "Game Design II" subject. I was in charge of the narrative
						design,
						including the
						worldbuilding, the characters, and most of the dialogues. I was also part of designing combat
						mechanics, although
						these aren't present in the text adventure and are only found in the GDD. Finally, I was the
						main person working on the documentation.</p>

					<p style="font-size: 85%">Game for the "Project III" subject. I was in charge of the narrative
						design, adapting the

						the Marvel Unvierse. I was also the main designer working on the player, iterating
						existing designs, and coming up with new abilities. Everything I've done in this project can be

						</pstyle>This is a VR Game designed for the "AR/VR" subject. For this project I was one of the
						main
						designers behind the conceptualization. I designed all
						puzzles and storybeats, as well as the characters, the layout of the map, and the interactions
						with the environment. A playthrough of the game can be seen <a
